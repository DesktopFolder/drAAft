# drAAft

A Minecraft 1.16.1 mod that makes various gameplay adjustments for a streamlined/ more consistent All Advancement
speedrun. Ideal for competitive events

## Features

### World Generation

- Increased Ancient Debris generation in the Nether
  - Ancient Debris spawns are now 2 attempts with baseline 16, spread 8, one with size 5 and one with size 4.
  - This does not change the optimal y-level for debris mining.
- Increased Lapis Lazuli generation
  - Lapis Lazuli spawns are now 4 attempts with baseline 16, spread 16, size 9 (was 7).
  - This does not change Bolan Clay/Gravel to Lapis Lazuli.
- Increased Lava Pool generation
  - Spawn attempt per chunk is 2x as likely
  - Snapping to surface is 2.5x as likely
- Igloos always generate with basements (was 50%)
- Thunder happens more often and is standardized per seed
    - Thunder will now occur every 10 - 45 minutes (was 10 - 150 minutes)
    - Rain will occur 1 - 7 minutes before thunder starts
    - This guarantees at least two 3+ minute thunders in 1.5 hours

### Mob Changes

- Animals can now spawn on Podzol blocks (in addition to grass)
    - This is intended for pandas in jungles but has side effects in other places such as mega taigas.
    - Bamboo Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Hills have a 30% chance to attempt a passive mob spawn attempt per chunk (was
      10%).
- Drowned:
    - Chance of spawning with Trident 18.75% (was 6.25%)
    - Chance of spawning with Fishing Rod 11.25% (was 3.75%)
    - Chance of spawning with Nautilus Shell 9% (was 3%).
    - Drowned equipment is standardized based on the world seed and block coordinates.
- Phantoms:
    - Spawn more frequently (15-60 second cooldown, down from 60-120 seconds)
    - Require less time without sleep to spawn (10 minutes, down from 60 minutes)
    - Always spawn at least 2 phantoms on Hard difficulty
    - The local difficulty multiplier of 3.0F has been removed, so the spawn attempt should succeed 3x as often
- Ender Dragon:
    - Fly-away will happen less frequently.
    - Dragon instant perch and straight node / diagonal node selection standardized based on the world seed.
- Endermite spawn chance per thrown pearl is now 7% (was 5%).
    - This changes the amount of pearls needed for a 99% chance of getting an Endermite to 64 (was 90).
    - Endermite spawns are standardized based on the world seed.

### Item Changes

- Elytra durability increased to 22,824 (from default)
    - This is to prevent losing to Unbreaking RNG.
